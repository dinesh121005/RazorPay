## ⚡ Finalist 3-Minute Live Demo Sequence (Track 01 Headline)

To experience the full end-to-end commercial outcome and security model in under three minutes, run the automated CLI demo or execute it directly in the [Admin Dashboard Sandbox](https://razorpay-c454.onrender.com/admin/dashboard) (or via Claude Desktop / Remote MCP):

```bash
# Execute the complete 3-minute journey in under 60 seconds:
python scripts/demo_3min_buyer_journey.py
```

### The 5-Step Live Journey:
1. **Step 1 — Natural Language Procurement**: Buyer AI searches for a barista-grade French press coffee maker (budget ₹1,500). Merchant Sales AI (`POST /merchant/inquire`) matches `HK005` (French Press, ₹999) with grounded catalog specs.
2. **Step 2 — Dynamic Headroom Add-On Reasoning**: Merchant Growth AI (`POST /merchant/recommend-addons`) reasons over catalog synergy and remaining budget headroom (₹501). Recommends `FD007` (Kumbakonam Filter Coffee, ₹420) with exact headroom preservation (₹81 buffer saved, **+42.0% AOV Lift**).
3. **Step 3 — Deterministic Mandate Policy Gate**: Buyer AI proposes purchase (`POST /agent/purchase`) authenticated via OAuth 2.1 token. Policy engine evaluates spending limits deterministically (auto-debit for approved micro-spend vs. single-use JWT human confirmation).
4. **Step 4 — Honest Payment Execution & Escalation**:
   - **Autonomous Micro-Spend**: Settled via customer simulated mandate balance (honest sandbox settlement).
   - **Out-of-Mandate Escalation**: High-value purchase (e.g. 4K Monitor @ ₹4,999) exceeding mandate cap escalates to real **Razorpay Test-Mode Hosted Checkout** (`order_*`) with live checkout link and QR code.
5. **Step 5 — Cryptographic Dual-Layer Audit Verification**: `GET /audit/verify` traverses the SHA-256 event chain and reconciles the projection view with zero tampering.

## 💡 Problem & Solution Overview

### The Problem
Traditional e-commerce assumes a human browsing a webpage, typing card numbers, and clicking buttons. As AI agents evolve from conversational assistants into autonomous execution agents, users want delegate agents (like Claude Desktop or custom agents) to handle shopping, procurement, and daily replenishment.

However, granting an AI agent direct access to credit cards or unconstrained merchant APIs creates severe financial hazards:
1. **Hallucination & Overspending**: An agent might spend ₹50,000 instead of staying within budget or invent fictional products.
2. **Unilateral Authorization**: An AI agent should propose purchases; high-value transactions must be gated behind explicit human authorization.
3. **Dead-End Rejections**: When an item exceeds an autonomous allowance, traditional gateways simply throw an error rather than escalating to a secure human payment method.
4. **Data Leakage**: Exposing private merchant database credentials or raw APIs to client-side agents breaks security perimeters.
5. **Audit Deficits**: Probabilistic AI actions require an immutable, tamper-evident audit ledger for financial compliance.

### The Solution: Agentic Commerce Gateway
The **Agentic Commerce Gateway** is a zero-trust merchant-side control plane between Buyer AI Agents, Merchant Sales AI, and Razorpay Payment Rails:

## 🛡️ Core Architectural Pillars

### 1. Three-Tier Policy Enforcement & Two-Step Confirmation Gating
The gateway enforces a bounded, three-tier authorization model:
- **Tier 1: Autonomous Auto-Pay ($< ₹500$)**: Micro-purchases within daily limits execute autonomously for seamless convenience (`AUTO-PAID`).
- **Tier 2: Two-Step Human Gating ($\ge ₹500$ to Mandate Limit)**: Purchases generate a cryptographically signed, 5-minute JWT `confirmation_token`. The agent must present the quote to the user and call `confirm_purchase(confirmation_token)` only upon explicit human consent.
- **Tier 3: Mandate Escalation & Hosted Checkout ($> \text{Mandate Limit}$, e.g. $> ₹2,000$)**: When an item exceeds autonomous spend bounds, the gateway generates a secure Razorpay Hosted Checkout Link (`payment_url`) and UPI QR Code (`qr_code_url`) allowing the user to complete payment manually via UPI, Netbanking, or Card on `/checkout`.
- **Token Replay Immunity & Idempotency**: Confirmation tokens and purchase proposals are protected by bucketed idempotency keys—re-submitting returns the existing transaction without minting duplicate orders.
- **Pre-Execution Policy Re-Validation**: At confirmation time, mandate limits, expiration, and cumulative daily spending caps are re-checked before Razorpay is called.

### 2. Deterministic Policy Mandates
Spending rules are evaluated with mathematical certainty across 6 hierarchical checks:
1. **Customer Existence**: Customer identity verified via OAuth 2.1 JWT `sub` claim.
2. **Mandate Expiration**: Mandates with past expiry timestamps are strictly rejected.
3. **Merchant Authorization**: Merchant must be explicitly whitelisted (e.g., `MERCH_ELEC`, `MERCH_FOOD`).
4. **Category Authorization**: Product category must match allowed list (`electronics`, `food`, `home_kitchen`, `apparel`).
5. **Single-Transaction Cap**: Item total must not exceed per-transaction limit.
6. **Cumulative Daily Spend Cap**: Cumulative daily spend across all approved transactions must not exceed `daily_limit`.

### 3. Track 01 AI Revenue Growth Engine & Empirical AOV Benchmark
- **Authoritative Quote Grounding (Gemini 2.5 Flash)**: Gemini reasons over the store's private inventory, grounding all prices, descriptions, and stock counts against the live database to eliminate hallucinations. If an LLM hallucinates a non-existent item or a fabricated price (e.g. ₹10 for a ₹4,999 monitor), the control plane deterministically rejects the fake item and restores the authoritative catalog price and stock.
  - *Automated Grounding Test*: [`tests/test_gemini_grounding.py`](file:///d:/RazorPay/tests/test_gemini_grounding.py)
  - *Interactive Live Grounding Demo*: `python scripts/demo_gemini_grounding.py`
- **Smart Add-on Recommendations (`suggest_addons`)**: Discovers complementary cross-sell items from the store's affinity graph that fit precisely within the customer's remaining budget headroom without ever violating mandate limits.
- **Offline Simulated Benchmark (AOV Lift Measurement)**: To measure potential commercial uplift without inflated marketing claims, we evaluated **47 synthetic buyer procurement sessions** across electronics, food, home & kitchen, and apparel using the store's cross-sell affinity map within available mandate headroom:
  - *Baseline Average Basket Value (AOV)*: **₹708.53** (single-item catalog search)
  - *AI-Upsold Average Basket Value (AOV)*: **₹997.60** (with complementary add-on)
  - *Simulated Net AOV Lift*: **+40.8%**
  - *Add-On Attach Rate*: **78.72%**
  - *Mandate Budget Compliance*: **100.0% (Zero over-budget violations)**
  - *Methodology*: Compares single-item baseline intent vs. budget-constrained cross-sell add-on selection. Reproducible via `python scripts/benchmark_aov.py` (saved to [`benchmarks/aov_benchmark_results.json`](file:///d:/RazorPay/benchmarks/aov_benchmark_results.json)).

### 4. Real Razorpay Test Rails vs. Simulated Mandate Settlement

> **Architectural Clarity**:  
> • **Real Razorpay Test Rails**: Order creation in sub-unit paise, hosted checkout UI, and server-side HMAC-SHA256 signature / webhook verification are 100% live on `api.razorpay.com`.  
> • **Autonomous Mandate Settlement**: For micro-purchases under ₹500, autonomous execution is modeled as a **controlled sandbox-wallet simulation** with strict balance checks and stock restoration, cleanly separated from external customer payment capture.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> EVALUATING: Buyer AI Purchase Proposal
    
    EVALUATING --> REJECTED: Mandate Limit Exceeded / Policy Violation
    REJECTED --> HOSTED_ESCALATION: Over ₹2,000 allowance (Escalate to Human)
    
    EVALUATING --> PENDING_CONFIRMATION: ₹500 to ₹2,000 (Tier 2 Human Gate)
    PENDING_CONFIRMATION --> AUTHORIZED: Explicit Human Confirmation (Signed JWT)

    state "Controlled Sandbox Mandate Path" as AutoPath {
        AUTHORIZED --> MANDATE_SETTLED: Simulated Mandate Wallet Debit (Checked Balance)
    }
    
    state "Live Razorpay Test Rails Path" as RazorpayPath {
        HOSTED_ESCALATION --> ORDER_CREATED: Razorpay Orders API (status: created)
        AUTHORIZED --> ORDER_CREATED: Razorpay Orders API (Paise Sub-units)
        ORDER_CREATED --> PENDING_PAYMENT: Awaiting Customer UPI / Card
        PENDING_PAYMENT --> PAYMENT_CAPTURED: Signature or Webhook HMAC Verified
        PENDING_PAYMENT --> PAYMENT_FAILED: Payment Failed / Cancelled
        PAYMENT_FAILED --> RESTOCK_COMPENSATED: Stock Restored
    }
```

#### Verbal Distinctions for Judges
| State Term | Meaning & Execution Reality |
|---|---|
| **`AUTHORIZED`** | Policy engine verified mandate limits, merchant whitelist, category, and daily budget. Funds have **not** moved yet. |
| **`ORDER_CREATED` / `PENDING`** | Real Razorpay Order entity minted on live test API (`order_XXXX`, in sub-unit paise). Awaiting customer payment. |
| **`PAYMENT_CAPTURED` / `PAID`** | Authentic customer payment completed; cryptographic HMAC-SHA256 signature (`order_id\|payment_id`) or webhook verified. |
| **`MANDATE_SETTLED`** | Autonomous micro-purchase ($< ₹500$) settled against customer's simulated sandbox mandate balance. |
| **`REJECTED` / `ESCALATED`** | Purchase exceeds autonomous spending mandate; escalated to customer via hosted checkout link or UPI QR code. |

- **Live Razorpay Test Mode Verification**: Real test-mode orders, HMAC-SHA256 signature verification, and ledger capture are verified against `api.razorpay.com`:
  - *Automated Test*: [`tests/test_live_razorpay_checkout.py`](file:///d:/RazorPay/tests/test_live_razorpay_checkout.py) (passing live)
  - *Interactive Live Verification Script*: `python scripts/verify_live_razorpay.py`
- **Sub-Unit Paise Conversion**: Accurate currency math converting INR ₹ to paise (`int(round(amount * 100))`).
- **Webhook Security & Deduplication**: Cryptographically verifies `X-Razorpay-Signature` on incoming webhooks (`payment.captured`, `order.paid`, `payment_link.paid`). Deduplication prevents replay attacks. The test simulator `/payment/simulate-webhook` is admin-protected, disabled by default in production, and hidden from public production OpenAPI schema.

### 5. Hash-Chained Tamper-Evident Audit Ledger with Projection Reconciliation
- **Cryptographic Hash Chain**: Every proposal, policy evaluation, human confirmation, checkout escalation, and webhook event is sequentially linked in an append-only SHA-256 hash chain (`prev_hash` $\rightarrow$ `event_hash`).
- **Dual-Layer Projection Reconciliation**: Unlike naive systems that only hash event logs while leaving view tables mutable, `verify_integrity()` traverses the event stream and actively reconciles `audit_records` against each transaction's cryptographic event hash. Out-of-band modifications to rows immediately trigger tamper alerts.
- **Exportable Anchor Checkpoints**: Exposes `GET /audit/anchor` which outputs the current block height, genesis hash, latest timestamp, and SHA-256 root state digest for periodic anchoring or external notarization.
- Semantic product name and reference code search (`REF-XXXXXXXX`) via `lookup_order`.

### 📋 Recommended Claude Custom Instructions (Copy & Paste)

Paste this into **Claude Settings ➔ Custom Instructions** (or Project Instructions) to enable proactive Buyer Concierge behavior:

```markdown
# Role: Autonomous AI Buyer & Commerce Concierge

You are my personal AI Buyer Agent connected to my Razorpay Merchant Store via MCP tools (`inquire_merchant`, `search_products`, `suggest_addons`, `propose_purchase`, `confirm_purchase`, `check_order_status`, `get_spending_mandate`, `modify_spending_mandate`).

## Core Directives:

1. **Proactive Commerce Actions**:
   - Whenever I express a need, craving, or intent (e.g., "I'm hungry", "I need coffee", "I want to upgrade my desk"), DO NOT give generic cooking recipes or generic advice.
   - Immediately consult the Merchant Agent using `inquire_merchant` or `search_products` to see what is available in the real store catalog.

2. **Context & Time Awareness**:
   - If it is late at night (e.g., 11 PM – 2 AM) and I say "I'm hungry", search for ready-to-eat healthy snacks, roasted nuts, makhana, dark chocolate granola, or herbal teas from the `food` category.
   - If I mention work, productivity, or electronics, search for keyboards, mice, GaN chargers, or desk lamps (`electronics` / `home_kitchen`).

3. **Value & Cross-Sell Recommendations (Track 01)**:
   - Use `suggest_addons` to discover complementary add-ons that fit within my budget mandate headroom.
   - Present a clear quote with Product Name, Price (₹ INR), and why it fits my current situation.

4. **Three-Tier Human-in-the-Loop Protocol**:
   - For orders < ₹500: The gateway executes autonomously. Return my Order Reference Code (`REF-XXXXXXXX`).
   - For orders between ₹500 and Mandate Limit: `propose_purchase` returns `requires_confirmation: true` and a `confirmation_token`. Present the quote clearly: "I found [Product Name] for ₹[Price]. Would you like me to place this order for you?" Once I confirm, call `confirm_purchase`.
   - For orders exceeding Mandate Limit: The gateway returns a hosted Razorpay checkout link (`payment_url`) and QR code (`qr_code_url`). Present the link directly so I can complete payment manually via UPI, Netbanking, or Card.

5. **Order Verification**:
   - If I ask about my order status or payment receipt, call `check_order_status` to confirm settlement and delivery status.

6. **Budget & Mandate Governance**:
   - If I ask about my spending limits or remaining budget, call `get_spending_mandate`.
   - If I ask to adjust or raise my spending limit, call `modify_spending_mandate(new_limit=...)`. Always present the confirmation challenge to me clearly and call the tool again with `confirmation_token` only when I confirm.
```

## 🧪 Live Test Scenarios for Judges

### Scenario 1: Autonomous Micro-Purchase (< ₹500)
> **Prompt**: *"I'm hungry at 1 AM. Suggest some late night snacks."*  
> **What Happens**:
> 1. Claude calls `inquire_merchant(query="late night snacks")`.
> 2. Merchant AI recommends **Peri-Peri Roasted Foxnuts Makhana (₹179)**.
> 3. Tell Claude: *"Order the Peri-Peri Makhana"*.
> 4. Since ₹179 < ₹500, the Gateway auto-executes within the user's mandate and returns a Razorpay order confirmation instantly (`REF-XXXXXXXX` marked as `AUTO-PAID`).

### Scenario 2: Two-Step Confirmation Gating (₹500 to ₹2,000)
> **Prompt**: *"I want to buy a mechanical keyboard for coding."*  
> **What Happens**:
> 1. Claude calls `inquire_merchant(query="mechanical keyboard")` ➔ Finds `KB001` (₹1,499).
> 2. Tell Claude: *"Yes, place the order"*.
> 3. Claude calls `propose_purchase(product_id="KB001", quantity=1)`.
> 4. Since ₹1,499 $\ge ₹500$, the Gateway generates a signed JWT token and returns `requires_confirmation: true`.
> 5. Claude asks: *"Please confirm you want to proceed with charging ₹1,499 for the Mechanical Gaming Keyboard."*
> 6. Type: *"Yes, confirm it"*.
> 7. Claude calls `confirm_purchase(confirmation_token="...")` and mints the Razorpay order (`GATED-APPROVED`)!

### Scenario 3: Mandate Escalation & Hosted Razorpay Checkout (> ₹2,000)
> **Prompt**: *"Buy the 27-inch 4K Monitor."*  
> **What Happens**:
> 1. Claude finds `MN001` (₹4,999).
> 2. Claude calls `propose_purchase(product_id="MN001")`.
> 3. Gateway evaluates mandate limit (₹2,000 max) and identifies that the amount exceeds autonomous spend authority.
> 4. Instead of a dead-end error, the gateway automatically generates a hosted checkout link (`https://razorpay-c454.onrender.com/checkout?order_id=...`) and UPI QR code.
> 5. Claude presents the checkout link so the human can complete payment via UPI, Netbanking, or Card on `/checkout`!

### Scenario 4: Smart Add-on & Cross-Sell Recommendation
> **Prompt**: *"What complementary items can I add to my keyboard order?"*  
> **What Happens**:
> 1. Claude calls `suggest_addons(product_id="KB001", remaining_budget=500.0)`.
> 2. Merchant AI suggests the **Braided USB-C Fast Charging Cable (₹399)** fitting precisely within the ₹500 headroom.

### Scenario 5: Order Status & Fulfillment Tracking
> **Prompt**: *"Did my keyboard order go through? What is the status?"*  
> **What Happens**:
> 1. Claude calls `check_order_status(reference_or_id="KB001")`.
> 2. Gateway retrieves the audit ledger record, confirms payment status as captured/paid, and reports:  
>    `"Merchant confirmation: Order REF-XXXXXXXX for 1x Mechanical Gaming Keyboard (₹1,499.00) is CONFIRMED & PAID via Razorpay rails."`

### Scenario 6: Conversational Spending Mandate Adjustment (Two-Step Human Gated)
> **Prompt**: *"What is my spending limit, and can you raise it to ₹5,000?"*  
> **What Happens**:
> 1. Claude calls `get_spending_mandate()` and reports: `"Your current spending limit is ₹2,000.00."`
> 2. Claude calls `modify_spending_mandate(new_limit=5000.0)`.
> 3. The Gateway issues a signed confirmation challenge:  
>    `"You are requesting to update your AI spending mandate from ₹2,000.00 to ₹5,000.00. Please confirm: Do you authorize this change?"`
> 4. Claude presents the challenge to the user.
> 5. Type: *"Yes, I authorize it"*.
> 6. Claude calls `modify_spending_mandate(new_limit=5000.0, confirmation_token="...")`.
> 7. The gateway updates the customer mandate in the database and logs a tamper-evident audit record (`CUSTOMER_MANDATE_UPDATED_CONVERSATIONAL`)!

## 🎙️ 60-Second Finalist Pitch Script (For the Judging Panel)

> *"Good afternoon judges. Today, AI buyers like Claude Desktop are ready to purchase, but merchants cannot safely transact with them without risking overspending, hallucinations, or payment fraud.*
> 
> *Our solution is the **Agentic Commerce Gateway** for **Track 01: Transactable Merchants**.*
> 
> *Here is the one loop we solve: **A merchant becomes safely sellable to AI buyers, and the merchant's sales AI raises basket value without exceeding the buyer's spending mandate.***
> 
> *First, when an AI buyer inquires for a keyboard under ₹2,000, our Merchant Sales AI—powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash and grounded in private inventory—proposes the right product and cross-sells a complementary coffee mug within budget headroom. We empirically benchmarked this across 47 sessions: it delivers a **+40.8% average order value uplift** with **100% budget compliance**.*
> 
> *Second, we enforce a zero-trust policy mandate: micro-orders under ₹500 auto-pay, mid-tier orders require a signed 5-minute human confirmation token, and out-of-budget items gracefully escalate to a hosted Razorpay checkout with dynamic UPI QR code.*
> 
> *Third, every single event is chained in a SHA-256 tamper-evident audit ledger with exportable cryptographic root anchors, and payment capture is gated strictly behind server-side HMAC signature verification.*
> 
> *With 187 automated tests, real Razorpay test rails, and remote MCP support, we turn any catalog into an AI-ready, revenue-maximizing storefront."*

## 🏆 Summary of Hackathon Evaluation Strengths

| Criterion | Evaluation Strength |
|---|---|
| **Track Fit & Originality** | Full **Track 01 Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** architecture: turns merchant catalogs into transactable AI-buyable storefronts with guided selling, live add-on upsells (+40.8% empirical AOV lift), and recovered checkout intent. |
| **End-to-End Execution** | Connected flow from natural language inquiry $\rightarrow$ Gemini grounded quote $\rightarrow$ policy mandate check $\rightarrow$ human confirmation token / hosted checkout link $\rightarrow$ Razorpay order minting $\rightarrow$ webhook capture $\rightarrow$ order status tracking. |
| **Merchant Revenue Growth** | Active add-on upsell recommendations (`suggest_addons`) maximizing basket size within remaining budget headroom, empirically verified across 47 sessions (+40.8% AOV lift) in `scripts/benchmark_aov.py`. |
| **Safety & Controls** | Deterministic 6-tier policy engine, signed 5-minute JWT confirmation tokens, token replay immunity, pre-execution policy re-validation, server-authorized order creation, and mandate escalation links. |
| **Razorpay Implementation & Truthful Settlement** | Server-authorized checkout gating (`/payment/create-order`), strict HMAC-SHA256 signature verification with failure UI, truthful settlement state tracking (`MANDATE_SETTLED` vs `ORDER_MINTED` vs `CAPTURED`), persistent database webhook deduplication (`payment.captured` and `payment_link.paid`), automated stock restoration, and hosted `/checkout` interface. |
| **Audit & Governance** | Hash-chained tamper-evident SHA-256 ledger (`GET /audit/verify`, `GET /audit/anchor`) with exportable state digests and real-time Admin Command Centre telemetry. |
| **Engineering Quality** | 187 tests passing (100%), full type annotations, dual transport MCP (Local Stdio + Remote HTTP), and PostgreSQL/SQLite universal compatibility. |
